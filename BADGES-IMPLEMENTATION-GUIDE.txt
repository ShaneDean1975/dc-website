SECTION STRUCTURE
-----------------

HTML Structure:
<section class="credentials-recognition">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Subtitle</p>
    <div class="badges-scroll-container">
      <div class="badges-track">
        <!-- Badge items (duplicated for seamless loop) -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

KEY CSS CLASSES:
- .credentials-recognition: Main section wrapper
- .badges-scroll-container: Overflow container with fade edges
- .badges-track: Scrolling track with animation
- .badge-item: Individual badge card
- .verdicts-style: Alternative dark theme

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
----------------------

1. CHANGE SCROLL SPEED
   Find this line in CSS:
   animation: scroll 40s linear infinite;
   
   Adjust the time value:
   - 30s = Faster scrolling
   - 50s = Slower scrolling
   - 40s = Default (recommended)

2. CHANGE BACKGROUND STYLE
   
   Light Background (Default):
   - background: white;
   
   Dark Background (Verdicts Style):
   - Add class "verdicts-style" to section
   - background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3a5f 0%, #2c4f7c 100%);

3. ADJUST BADGE SIZE
   Find .badge-item in CSS:
   flex: 0 0 280px; (current width)
   
   Change to:
   - 240px = Smaller badges
   - 320px = Larger badges

4. MODIFY GAP BETWEEN BADGES
   Find .badges-track in CSS:
   gap: 60px; (current spacing)
   
   Change to:
   - 40px = Closer together
   - 80px = Further apart

5. CHANGE HOVER BEHAVIOR
   Find .badge-item:hover in CSS
   
   Current: Lifts up and adds shadow
   Options:
   - Remove transform for no lift
   - Increase scale for more dramatic effect
   - Change shadow values

ADDING MORE BADGES
-------------------

To add additional credentials/awards:

1. Add new badge image to your server
2. Duplicate a badge-item block in the HTML
3. Update image src, alt text, title, and description
4. Add the same badge to the duplicate set (for seamless loop)

Example:
<div class="badge-item">
    <img src="your-new-badge.png" 
         alt="Your Badge Name - Dean & Camper P.A." 
         loading="lazy"
         width="120"
         height="120">
    <h3>Your Badge Name</h3>
    <p>Description of the award or membership</p>
</div>

IMPORTANT: Maintain even number of badges for best visual balance

SEO OPTIMIZATION
----------------

✓ SEMANTIC HTML
  Each badge uses proper heading hierarchy and semantic structure

✓ SCHEMA MARKUP
  Award schema added to structured data:
  "award": [
      "Million Dollar Advocates Forum",
      "Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum",
      "Super Lawyers",
      "American Association for Justice"
  ]

✓ DESCRIPTIVE ALT TEXT
  Format: "[Badge Name] Member - Dean & Camper P.A."
  Examples:
  - "Million Dollar Advocates Forum Member - Dean & Camper P.A."
  - "Super Lawyers - Shane Dean"

✓ IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
  - Width/height attributes prevent layout shift
  - loading="lazy" for performance
  - Proper file naming for SEO

✓ ACCESSIBLE DESIGN
  - Sufficient color contrast
  - Readable font sizes
  - Keyboard navigation friendly
  - Screen reader compatible

AI SEARCH OPTIMIZATION

### Hero Section:
**H1:** Premises Liability Lawyers
**Subheading:** Property owners have a duty to keep their premises safe. When they fail, we hold them accountable for slip and falls, negligent security, and dangerous conditions.

### Main Content Outline:

**Introduction:**
Property owners - whether businesses, landlords, or private homeowners - have a legal duty to maintain reasonably safe premises for visitors. When dangerous conditions cause injuries, victims have the right to seek compensation through premises liability claims. These cases require proving the property owner knew or should have known about the hazard and failed to fix it or warn visitors.

At Dean & Camper, P.A., we've successfully represented numerous clients injured on unsafe properties throughout Pensacola, Destin, Fort Walton Beach, Mobile, and the Gulf Coast. We know how to prove property owner negligence and overcome their defenses.

**Types of Premises Liability Cases:**
- Slip and fall accidents
- Trip and fall accidents
- Negligent security (assaults, robberies, attacks)
- Inadequate lighting causing accidents
- Broken stairs and railings
- Wet or slippery floors
- Uneven pavement and parking lots
- Swimming pool accidents
- Elevator and escalator accidents
- Falling merchandise or displays
- Toxic substances and chemical exposure
- Dog bites on property
- Fires due to code violations
- Inadequate maintenance

**Common Dangerous Conditions:**
- Wet or freshly mopped floors without warnings
- Spills not cleaned promptly
- Torn or wrinkled carpeting
- Broken or uneven stairs

- Poor lighting in walkways or parking areas
- Icy sidewalks (rare in Gulf Coast but does happen)
- Debris in walkways
- Hidden hazards
- Improperly maintained premises

**Property Owner Duties in Florida & Alabama:**

**Florida Law:**
- Duty owed depends on visitor status (invitee, licensee, trespasser)
- Invitees: Business customers owed highest duty of care
- Must warn of or fix known dangerous conditions
- Must inspect for hazards regularly
- Comparative negligence may reduce damages

**Alabama Law:**
- Similar duty based on visitor status
- Property owners must exercise reasonable care
- Must warn of hidden dangers
- Contributory negligence can bar recovery (harsh rule)
- Exceptions for wanton or willful conduct

**Proving a Premises Liability Claim:**
Successful claims require proving:
1. **Dangerous Condition Existed** - Hazard on the property
2. **Owner Had Notice** - Actual or constructive knowledge of hazard
3. **Failure to Fix or Warn** - Owner didn't remedy or warn visitors
4. **Causation** - Condition caused your injury
5. **Damages** - You suffered actual harm

**Actual vs. Constructive Notice:**
- **Actual Notice:** Owner knew about the hazard
- **Constructive Notice:** Hazard existed long enough that owner should have known
- Proving constructive notice often requires evidence of how long condition existed

**Negligent Security Claims:**
When inadequate security leads to crimes on property:
- Assaults in parking lots
- Robberies in poorly lit areas
- Attacks in apartment complexes
- Hotel room break-ins
- Insufficient security guards
- Broken locks or gates
- Prior criminal activity on property

Requires proving:
- Crime was foreseeable based on area/history

- Head injuries and concussions

**Defenses Property Owners Use:**

- Condition was open and obvious
- Victim was trespassing
- Victim's own negligence caused fall
- Condition wasn't dangerous
- Victim wasn't paying attention

We know how to overcome these defenses with proper evidence and expert testimony.

**Time Limits:**
- Florida: 2 years for premises liability claims (4 years if seeking only property damage)
- Alabama: 2 years for personal injury
- Government property: Shorter notice requirements

### Hero Section:
**H1:** Defective Product Lawyers
**Subheading:** When dangerous or defective products cause harm, manufacturers must be held accountable. We fight for victims of defective vehicles, medical devices, drugs, and consumer products.

### Main Content Outline:

**Introduction:**
Every day, consumers trust that the products they buy are safe. When manufacturers cut corners, fail to test adequately, or hide known dangers, innocent people suffer catastrophic injuries or death. Product liability law holds manufacturers, distributors, and sellers accountable for defective products that cause harm.

At Dean & Camper, P.A., we have extensive experience with complex product liability cases. Our attorneys have recovered millions for clients injured by defective products, including a $3.5 million product liability wrongful death settlement. We take on major corporations and fight for the compensation you deserve.

- Defect occurred during production
- Examples: contaminated medications, improperly assembled parts

- Retail stores that sold the product
- Assemblers
- Installers
- Companies that provided warnings (or failed to)

**Strict Liability in Product Cases:**
Unlike negligence claims, product liability uses "strict liability":
- Don't need to prove manufacturer was negligent
- Only need to prove product was defective and caused injury
- Applies to anyone in the chain of distribution
- Makes it easier to hold manufacturers accountable

**Common Injuries from Defective Products:**
- Traumatic brain injuries
- Burns and scarring
- Amputations and loss of limbs
- Spinal cord injuries
- Internal organ damage
- Blindness and vision loss
- Permanent disabilities

3. **Defect caused injury** - Direct link between defect and harm
4. **Product used as intended** - Or in reasonably foreseeable way
5. **Damages** - Actual harm suffered

**Compensation Available:**

```

### Hero Section:
**H1:** Dog Bite Lawyers
**Subheading:** Florida and Alabama dog bite laws protect victims of animal attacks. We help children and adults recover compensation from negligent dog owners and their homeowner's insurance.

### Main Content Outline:

**Introduction:**
Dog bites and animal attacks cause serious injuries, especially to children. Each year, millions of Americans are bitten by dogs, resulting in emergency room visits, surgeries, permanent scarring, and psychological trauma. Florida and Alabama have different laws regarding dog owner liability, and understanding these differences is crucial to recovering compensation.

At Dean & Camper, P.A., we represent dog bite victims throughout Pensacola, Destin, Fort Walton Beach, Mobile, and the Gulf Coast. We know how to navigate Florida's strict liability statute and Alabama's one-bite rule to hold negligent dog owners accountable.

**Dog Bite Statistics:**
- 4.5 million dog bites occur annually in the U.S.
- Children are the most common victims
- Face and neck injuries are most common in children
- Homeowner's insurance pays over $1 billion annually in dog bite claims
- Average settlement: $50,000+

**Florida Dog Bite Law - Strict Liability:**

Florida Statute 767.04 imposes strict liability:
- **Dog owner is liable** regardless of dog's prior behavior
- **No "one free bite" rule** - even first-time bites create liability
- **No need to prove negligence** - strict liability statute
- **Exceptions:** Trespassing, comparative negligence if victim provoked dog

This makes Florida one of the most victim-friendly states for dog bite cases.

**Alabama Dog Bite Law - Scienter (One-Bite Rule):**

Alabama follows common law "one-bite rule":
- **Must prove owner knew or should have known dog was dangerous**
- Prior bites, aggressive behavior, breed reputation can establish knowledge
- Alternative: **Negligence** - owner failed to properly restrain dog
- Alternative: **Premises liability** - dangerous condition on property

Alabama law is less favorable to victims but claims are still possible.

**Common Dog Bite Injuries:**
- Puncture wounds and lacerations
- Facial scarring and disfigurement
- Eye injuries and vision loss
- Broken bones from knock-downs
- Nerve damage
- Infections (including rabies risk)
- Tendon and muscle damage
- Emotional trauma and PTSD
- Need for reconstructive surgery
- Permanent scarring

**Children as Dog Bite Victims:**
Children are especially vulnerable:
- Face and head injuries more common
- Long-term psychological trauma
- Permanent scarring on growing bodies
- Fear of dogs and animals
- Developmental impacts

Courts are particularly sympathetic to child victims.

**Dangerous Dog Breeds:**
While any dog can bite, certain breeds are statistically more dangerous:
- Pit Bulls (responsible for most fatal attacks)
- Rottweilers
- German Shepherds
- Huskies
- Doberman Pinschers
- Mastiffs
- Chows

However, breed alone doesn't determine liability - owner responsibility matters most.

**When Dog Owners Are Liable:**
- Dog bites or attacks anyone lawfully on property
- Dog escapes and attacks someone off property
- Dog shows signs of aggression and owner fails to control
- Owner violates leash laws
- Owner knows dog is dangerous and fails to secure properly
- Dog attacks postal workers, delivery drivers, guests

**Defenses Dog Owners Use:**
- Victim was trespassing
- Victim provoked the dog
- Comparative negligence (victim's actions contributed)
- No prior knowledge dog was dangerous (Alabama)
- Warning sign posted (may reduce but not eliminate liability)

We know how to overcome these defenses.

**Homeowner's Insurance Coverage:**
Most dog bite claims are paid by owner's homeowner's insurance:
- Typical policies cover $100,000-$300,000
- Many policies exclude certain breeds
- Some insurers refuse coverage after one bite
- We deal directly with insurance companies

**Compensation Available:**
- Medical expenses (emergency care, surgery, reconstructive procedures)
- Future medical costs for ongoing treatment
- Plastic surgery and scar revision
- Pain and suffering
- Emotional distress and PTSD
- Permanent scarring and disfigurement
- Lost wages if unable to work
- Counseling and therapy

**Reporting Dog Bites:**
Important steps after an attack:
- Report to local animal control
- Report to police (criminal report)
- Report to health department (rabies risk)
- Get dog owner's contact and insurance information
- Document the dog (photos, breed, size)
- Creates official record and protects others

**Proving Damages in Dog Bite Cases:**
- Medical records and bills
- Photos of injuries (immediately and during healing)
- Expert testimony on permanent scarring
- Psychological evaluation for PTSD
- Before and after photos
- Witness statements
- Economic damages for lost wages

**Statute of Limitations:**
- Florida: 2 years from date of bite
- Alabama: 2 years from date of bite
- Don't delay - investigation should start immediately

**Rabies Concerns:**
If dog's vaccination status is unknown:
- Victim may need rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (painful series of shots)
- Dog must be quarantined and observed
- Owner can be held liable for treatment costs
- Failure to vaccinate dog may increase liability

**Leash Laws:**
Most Florida and Alabama municipalities have leash laws:
- Dogs must be on leash in public spaces
- Violations establish negligence
- Even friendly dogs must be leashed
- Strengthens liability case

**What to Do After a Dog Bite:**
1. **Seek immediate medical attention** - Even minor bites can get infected
2. **Clean wound thoroughly** - Reduce infection risk
3. **Document injuries** - Photos from multiple angles
4. **Get dog owner information** - Name, address, insurance, dog vaccination records
5. **Report to authorities** - Animal control, police, health department
6. **Keep all medical records** - Bills, treatment notes, prescriptions
7. **Don't sign anything from owner or insurance company**
8. **Contact attorney** - Before giving statements
